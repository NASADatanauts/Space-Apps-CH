# üå± 1. Challenge Title:
**From Farm to Table: Using Space Data to Support Swiss Farmers and Reduce Food Waste**

<img width="1024" height="577" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e224b86-38ab-45b0-8f3c-71ecfd931d0e" />




## üß© Challenge Statement
Swiss farmers face increasing uncertainty due to changing climate conditions, unpredictable weather, and shifting demand in local markets. At the same time, food waste remains a major issue in Switzerland ‚Äî often due to supply-demand mismatches and limited forecasting tools for small producers.

**How can we use Earth observation data to help Swiss farmers better align production with demand, adapt to environmental conditions, and reduce food waste along the supply chain?**



## üöÄ Your Mission
Develop tools or insights using satellite data and open APIs that enable:

- Better forecasting of crop yields and harvest conditions in Switzerland  
- Smarter connections between local supply and retail/consumer demand  
- Identification of regions at risk for weather-related crop losses  
- Improved coordination among producers, distributors, and retailers  
- Data-driven strategies to reduce overproduction and post-harvest waste  

### You could build:
- A platform or dashboard for Swiss farmers to monitor their fields  
- A crop prediction model using weather and soil data  
- A system to help match excess supply with food processors or markets  
- Visualizations showing how climate events affect local agriculture
