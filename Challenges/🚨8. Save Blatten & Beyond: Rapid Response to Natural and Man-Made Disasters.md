## 🧊 Real-World Trigger: The Glacier Disaster in Blatten

On **May 29, 2025**, the quiet Alpine village of **Blatten (Valais, Switzerland)** was hit by one of the largest glacier-related landslides ever recorded in Swiss history. The disaster largely destroyed the village.

Thanks to early warnings and swift evacuation, most lives were saved—but one person is still missing, and the community was left devastated.

This event is part of a rising global trend: climate-driven glacier melt and mountain instability are triggering more frequent and intense hazards—from the Alps to the Andes and Himalayas.

> **What if we could predict these disasters? Or respond faster—even to man-made catastrophes like toxic spills, fires, or explosions?**



## 🚀 Your Mission

Build a solution that helps detect, visualize, or respond to disasters like the 2025 Blatten glacier collapse—or similar man-made events—in real time using satellite **SAR** and open data.

Design a tool, app, dashboard, or data story that uses **Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)** or other satellite-based Earth observation to support **early warning, crisis management, or rapid response** in high-risk areas.



## 🎯 Choose One or More Challenge Tracks

### 1. 🛰️ Glacier Hazard Detection & Monitoring
Use SAR data (e.g., Sentinel-1, ALOS-2) to identify glacier movement, ground deformation, or early warning signals before a landslide.

### 2. 🌊 Rapid Response to Landslides or Floods
Detect disaster extent within hours using SAR’s all-weather, day/night capability to map affected zones, blocked roads, or damaged infrastructure.

### 3. ☣️ Man-Made Catastrophe Monitoring
Design a SAR+data fusion tool to identify environmental impacts from:
- Toxic spills (in water/soil)
- Fires or explosions
- Infrastructure collapse (bridges, tunnels, power plants)

### 4. 🧭 Disaster Coordination & Communication Dashboard
Build a centralized platform for first responders that fuses:
- Satellite imagery
- Sensor data
- Citizen input

To:
- Prioritize rescue efforts  
- Share real-time situational awareness  
- Model risk in similar regions  

### 5. 🎥 Interactive StoryMap or Simulation
Tell the story of the Blatten disaster (or a simulated future one) using real satellite data + modeling to show:
- What happened?
- How was it detected?
- How can we prepare better?
