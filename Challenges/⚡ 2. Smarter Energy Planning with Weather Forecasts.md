# ⚡ Challenge 2: Smarter Energy Planning with Weather Forecasts  

## ⚡ The Problem  

One of the biggest challenges in today’s energy systems is the **unpredictability of photovoltaic (PV) production**. Unlike conventional power plants, solar cannot be controlled on demand. Sudden weather changes—like snowfall, rapid temperature drops, or unexpected cloud cover—can drastically reduce output within minutes.  

This mismatch between **fast-changing solar output** and **slow, aggregated data** leads to large forecasting errors. Grid operators are then forced to procure balancing energy at short notice, which can cost **millions of CHF in just hours**.  

### Real-World Risks  
- **Snowfall** → Instantly blocks PV panels, cutting output to nearly zero.  
- **Temperature drops** → Increase energy demand just as PV production falls.  
- **Cloud cover** → Sharp, unpredictable dips in generation.
-  **Slow meter data** → Many Swiss smart meters provide only one reading per day, leaving operators “blind” to fast-changing conditions.   

When forecasts fail, balancing companies face **heavy financial penalties** and consumers ultimately bear the cost through higher energy prices.

## ⚡ Why It Matters  
Poor solar forecasting undermines both **affordability** and **reliability** of the National Grid operations.
It is not  just a technical issue—it directly affects Switzerland’s power stability.  
- Snowfall, temperature drops, or cloud cover can disrupt PV production within minutes.  
- Swissgrid, the national grid operator, must then buy balancing energy at extreme spot prices at the flex market.  
- These interventions quickly escalate into multi-million CHF costs.  

### Case Example: April 22, 2024 (Switzerland)  
- **Event:** Sudden snowfall sharply reduced PV output.  
- **Impact:** Solar production dropped to near zero.  
- **Response:** Grid Operator secured emergency balancing energy.  
- **Cost:** CHF **3 million** in just **1 hour** (2–3 p.m.) as prices spiked to **> CHF 2,000/MWh** (vs. ~CHF 70/MWh normally).  

📊 **2024 Balancing Energy Costs in Switzerland**  
| Event | PV Impact | Cost to Switzerland |  
|-------|-----------|------------------|  
| April 22, 2024 (snowfall) | PV output near zero | CHF 3 million in 1 hour |  
| Multiple forecast errors (2024) | Frequent mismatches | CHF 370 million total in 2024 |

## ⚡ Why Real-Time Calculations Are Hard  

Despite advanced forecasting tools, **several structural challenges** make real-time balancing difficult:  

### ⏳ Delayed Meter Data  
- Many smart meters in Switzerland only provide **one reading per day**.  
- Grid operators don’t see real-time production/consumption, leaving them “flying blind.”  

### 🔒 Privacy Constraints  
- Energy data is **highly sensitive** and regulated.  
- Privacy laws limit the **granularity and frequency** of available data.  
- This restricts operators from reacting instantly to sudden shifts.  

### 🌤️ Volatility of Solar Power  
- PV output can fluctuate within **minutes** due to snow, clouds, or temperature swings.  
- Unlike fossil or hydro plants, solar cannot be dispatched or ramped up on demand.  

✅ **Summary:**  
Forecast errors in PV production are not only a technical issue—they create **financial risks, grid instability, and consumer costs**. Smarter energy planning with weather forecasts is essential to ensure **affordable and reliable electricity** in Switzerland’s renewable-driven future.

## 💡 The Challenge
Build innovative tools that integrate weather, satelite data,  and meteorological forecasts (temperature, wind, clouds affect) into energy planning to:
- Predict short- and medium-term electricity consumption more accurately.  
- Anticipate demand spikes during cold snaps or heatwaves.  
- Reduce costly balancing energy and improve grid stability.  
- Support Switzerland’s clean energy transition.  

## 🔎 Guiding Questions
- How can we use weather data to forecast consumption at the grid or local level?  
- Can probabilistic forecasts (uncertainty ranges) help operators plan better?  
- How do microclimates in Swiss regions (mountains, lakes, cities) affect demand?  
- Can we combine renewable production forecasts with consumption insights into one model?
- Can **probabilistic forecasts** (with uncertainty ranges) reduce financial risks for balancing groups?  
- How do **microclimates** (mountains, valleys, lakes, cities) impact PV output and demand patterns?  
- Can forecasts for **consumption + renewable generation** be combined into a single planning tool?
