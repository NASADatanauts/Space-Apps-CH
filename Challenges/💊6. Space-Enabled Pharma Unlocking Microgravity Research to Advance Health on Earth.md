## üß© Challenge Statement  
What if breakthroughs in **drug development, disease modeling, or cell biology** could come from space?  

NASA and ESA conduct ongoing biological and pharmaceutical research in **microgravity** to better understand:  
- Disease mechanisms  
- Protein crystallization  
- Tissue growth  
- Immune response  
- Other health-related processes  

These insights have the potential to accelerate innovation in **medicine and biotechnology on Earth**.  

**How can Swiss pharmaceutical or biotech companies harness existing space biology research and data to develop new therapies, improve clinical models, or enhance drug R&D processes?**
