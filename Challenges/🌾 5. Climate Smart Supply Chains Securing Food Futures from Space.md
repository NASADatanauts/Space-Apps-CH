<img width="1200" height="712" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e9593bc5-e06d-42eb-9c22-9fcfab36c2d8" />



## 🧩 Challenge Statement  
Retailers and distributors source food and agricultural products from a complex global network — one increasingly vulnerable to **climate disruptions** like drought, floods, heatwaves, and shifting growing zones.  

**How might we use Earth observation data to monitor agricultural risks, improve transparency in supply chains, and reduce food waste?**  


## 🚀 Your Mission  
Use **open satellite data and APIs** from NASA, ESA, and Swiss platforms to develop tools or insights that help food retailers:  

- Monitor agricultural conditions in real time (e.g., drought, soil moisture, vegetation health)  
- Forecast potential supply chain disruptions due to environmental conditions  
- Improve transparency and traceability for climate-sensitive products (like produce, coffee, grains)  
- Support smarter inventory & demand planning to reduce food waste  

### You might build:  
- A **climate-risk dashboard** for supply chains  
- A **food product resilience index** based on regional climate data  
- A **map layer** visualizing at-risk crop regions or sourcing zones  
- A **machine learning model** predicting disruptions based on past climate events

## 🏆 Evaluation Criteria

| **Criteria** | **Description** | **Points** |
|---------------|------------------|-------------|
| **Impact on Supply Chains & Climate Resilience** | Does it help retailers, distributors, or producers better anticipate and adapt to climate-related disruptions in the food supply chain? | **30** |
| **Use of Space & Earth Observation Data** | Creative and effective use of satellite datasets (e.g., Sentinel, MODIS, SMAP, GPM) or open APIs to monitor agricultural and environmental risks | **25** |
| **Innovation & Analytical Depth** | Does the project introduce a new way to analyze or visualize climate risks, improve transparency, or forecast disruptions in the food system? | **20** |
| **Usability & Clarity of Insights** | Are the outputs intuitive for stakeholders (e.g., retailers, policymakers, or farmers)? Does it clearly communicate risk and enable action? | **15** |
| **Scalability & Sustainability** | Can the idea scale to other regions or supply chains? Does it encourage more sustainable sourcing and waste reduction? | **10** |
| **Total** |  | **100** |


## 💡 Bonus Ideas
