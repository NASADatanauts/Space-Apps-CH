## ðŸ§  Workshop Overview  
**Title:** Deep Learning in Economics â€“ Models, Applications & Critical Insights  
**Facilitator:** [Dr. Stefanie Wedel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stefaniewedel)

In this workshop, **Dr. Stefanie Wedel** explored how deep learning is transforming modern economics â€” from predictive modeling and financial forecasting to policy optimization and intelligent decision-making.  

Participants were introduced to key architectures such as **DNNs**, **CNNs**, **RNNs**, and hybrid models, and discussed their applications across **macroeconomics**, **financial markets**, and **sustainable development analysis**.  

The session was inspired by the recent publication  
> *[Deep Learning in Economics: A Systematic and Critical Review](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10462-022-10272-8)*  
by **Yuanhang Zheng et al. (2023)** â€” providing a structured understanding of the evolution, opportunities, and challenges of integrating AI in economic research.  

Dr. Wedel also shared **practical resources** and a **Jupyter notebook** to help participants explore deep learning workflows for economic data.
