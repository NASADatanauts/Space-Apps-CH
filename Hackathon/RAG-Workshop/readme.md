## ðŸ§  ðŸš€ Workshop: Building a Simple Retrieval-Augmented Generator (RAG) with OpenAI

**Subtitle** : Talk with your PDFs!
**Facilitator:** [Stefanie Wedel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stefaniewedel)


In this workshop, **Stefanie Wedel** explored how to build a simple RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline that scales.

ðŸŒŸ What Youâ€™ll Learn
- Load and process PDFs from Google Drive
- Clean and chunk text into manageable pieces
- Create embeddings with OpenAI
- Build a vector database (FAISS) for fast search
- Retrieve relevant chunks in response to questions
- Use OpenAIâ€™s Chat API to generate answers from context

The session was inspired by the recent publication  
> *[Deep Learning in Economics: A Systematic and Critical Review](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10462-022-10272-8)*  
by **Yuanhang Zheng et al. (2023)** â€” providing a structured understanding of the evolution, opportunities, and challenges of integrating AI in economic research.  

Stefanie shared the Jupyter Notebook as well as the publication, helping participants explore practical workflows for building retrieval-augmented question-answering systems â€” with a special note on what the temperature parameter in a RAG system actually means.
