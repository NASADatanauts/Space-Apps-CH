🥇 **1st Place:** [Ryks8Mortys](https://www.spaceappschallenge.org/2025/find-a-team/ryksampmorty/) — *Award: Victorinox knife*  


**Project:** *Ryks&Morty* — an AI-powered decision-support platform for sustainable urban traffic management.  

Ryks8Mortys created **Ryks&Morty**, an intelligent simulation platform that helps **city planners optimize traffic flow** and **reduce congestion** using **reinforcement learning** and **environmental modeling**.  
The system simulates Zurich’s road network with **SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility)** and **Reinforcement Learning agents**, allowing planners to experiment with traffic light coordination, road closures, and emergency scenarios. It integrates data on **pollution, CO₂ emissions, and mobility patterns**, helping evaluate both **mobility efficiency** and **environmental impact**.  

Through realistic simulations, the platform supports **evidence-based decision-making** — enabling planners to predict how infrastructure changes or large events (like Zurich’s Street Parade) will affect the city. The result is a tool that contributes to **smarter, cleaner, and more resilient cities**.  

Built using **Python**, **SUMO-RL**, **React**, and **Scikit-learn**, the project demonstrates how AI and open urban data can enhance real-world decision-making for sustainable mobility planning.

# 🥈 **2nd Place:** [Per Aspera](https://www.spaceappschallenge.org/2025/find-a-team/per-aspera5/) 
<img width="2048" height="1365" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1278dc65-78d3-4d8a-ad17-76ad96168a60" />

🥈 **2nd Place:** [Per Aspera](https://www.spaceappschallenge.org/2025/find-a-team/per-aspera5/) — *Award: Galaxus gift cards*  
**Project:** *AURA* — a navigation app designed to enhance women’s safety in urban environments.  

Per Aspera developed **AURA**, a smart navigation app that helps users find the **safest walking routes** through cities at night. By combining **NASA satellite imagery** with **urban open data**—including Zurich’s streetlight intensity maps, live pedestrian flow data, and community reports of unsafe areas—AURA calculates and displays the most secure paths using an **A\*** routing algorithm.  

The app presents both **safe and alternative routes** on an interactive map, enhanced with a **real-time safety heatmap**. Users can also contribute new safety observations, share their live location with trusted contacts, or activate features like **“comfort calls”** and emergency alerts when feeling unsafe.  

Developed with a **Java backend** and **HTML UI**, AURA blends **AI-assisted prototyping**, synthetic data generation, and NASA-powered mapping to create a solution that improves both **actual and perceived safety** for women walking at night.

### 🌍 Global Nominee: [Cosmo Hunters](https://www.spaceappschallenge.org/2025/find-a-team/cosmo-hunters/)  
**Project:** *CosmoScan* — an AI-powered tool for exoplanet discovery.  

Cosmo Hunters created **CosmoScan**, a machine learning platform that automates the identification of potential exoplanets from NASA’s **Kepler Objects of Interest (KOI)** dataset.  
Users can upload astronomical data files, which the system processes with a **Random Forest ML model** to determine whether each object is likely an exoplanet. The tool then generates a downloadable CSV with the classification results and probabilities — making exoplanet research faster, more accessible, and shareable.  

Built with **React + TypeScript**, **FastAPI**, and **Google Cloud**, CosmoScan demonstrates how AI can accelerate astronomical discovery and empower both scientists and enthusiasts to explore the universe.
