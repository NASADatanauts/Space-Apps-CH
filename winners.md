# 🚀🌌 NASA Space Apps Challenge — Winners Announcement! 🌍

A huge **congratulations** to all our incredible teams for their **creativity, collaboration, and innovation** throughout this year’s hackathon! 💫  
After an amazing weekend of **problem-solving, exploration, and inspiration**, here are the results:


## 🏆 Local Winners:
🥇 **1st Place:** Ryks8Mortys, Victorinox knifes

🥈 **2nd Place:** [Per Aspera](https://www.spaceappschallenge.org/2025/find-a-team/per-aspera5/) — *Award: Galaxus gift cards*  
**Project:** *AURA* — a navigation app designed to enhance women’s safety in urban environments.  

Per Aspera developed **AURA**, a smart navigation app that helps users find the **safest walking routes** through cities at night. By combining **NASA satellite imagery** with **urban open data**—including Zurich’s streetlight intensity maps, live pedestrian flow data, and community reports of unsafe areas—AURA calculates and displays the most secure paths using an **A\*** routing algorithm.  

The app presents both **safe and alternative routes** on an interactive map, enhanced with a **real-time safety heatmap**. Users can also contribute new safety observations, share their live location with trusted contacts, or activate features like **“comfort calls”** and emergency alerts when feeling unsafe.  

Developed with a **Java backend** and **HTML UI**, AURA blends **AI-assisted prototyping**, synthetic data generation, and NASA-powered mapping to create a solution that improves both **actual and perceived safety** for women walking at night.

## 💫 Special Recognitions:
🌍 **Global Nominee:** Cosmo Hunters  
https://www.spaceappschallenge.org/2025/find-a-team/cosmo-hunters/
### 🌍 Global Nominee: [Cosmo Hunters](https://www.spaceappschallenge.org/2025/find-a-team/cosmo-hunters/)  
**Project:** *CosmoScan* — an AI-powered tool for exoplanet discovery.  

Cosmo Hunters created **CosmoScan**, a machine learning platform that automates the identification of potential exoplanets from NASA’s **Kepler Objects of Interest (KOI)** dataset.  
Users can upload astronomical data files, which the system processes with a **Random Forest ML model** to determine whether each object is likely an exoplanet. The tool then generates a downloadable CSV with the classification results and probabilities — making exoplanet research faster, more accessible, and shareable.  

Built with **React + TypeScript**, **FastAPI**, and **Google Cloud**, CosmoScan demonstrates how AI can accelerate astronomical discovery and empower both scientists and enthusiasts to explore the universe.
